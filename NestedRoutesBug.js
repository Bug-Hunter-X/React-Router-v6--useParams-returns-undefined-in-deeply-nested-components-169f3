In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when using the `useParams` hook within a component nested several levels deep.  The problem occurs when the route parameters are not correctly propagated down the component tree, often resulting in `undefined` values for the parameters despite the route being correctly matched. This can stem from the way React's rendering and reconciliation work, and how React Router handles its internal state updates.
